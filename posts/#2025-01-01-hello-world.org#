This is my first blog post. I'm not sure what this will evolve into in the future. For now I just want to focus on trying to post regularly, to get a rhythm going, momentum.
I definitely want to cover technical subjects here but I'm not sure what else. I like blogs that cover a range of things and are an expression of the creators taste.
